You can download the latest version from here:

https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/archives/master

Alternatively, the very latest version is available here:

git clone git://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.git

You should be able to build it on most systems with:
make
(make test)

If that fails, you try:
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
(make test)
make install

Note that ./autogen.sh requires automake.  On OSX, this implies installing 'glibtools'

Be sure to read the wiki: https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki
for the tutorial, command line options, etc.  

The 'cluster' directory has it's own documentation for cluster
parallel use, and the examples at the end of test/Runtests give some
example flags.
